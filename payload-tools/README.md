# StagedPayload.cs

This is a staged payload written in C# that takes an IP address and uses it to connect back to an "attack machine" that has the second stage of the payload.

## Usage

To use this payload, you will need to compile it first. You can do this by using the `csc` command that comes with the .NET Framework.

csc StagedPayload.cs

Once the payload has been compiled, you will need to change the IP address in the file `StagedPayload.cs` before you can use it. The IP address is currently set to "127.0.0.1", replace it with the IP address of the attack machine. 

After you have changed the IP address in the file, you can use the payload by running the following command:
./StagedPayload.exe

## Note
This is just an example, this kind of actions could be illegal in some countries, use it only in authorized penetration testing environments.

## Conclusion

That's it! The payload will now connect back to the attack machine and execute the second stage of the payload. Make sure that the attack machine is listening for incoming connections on the specified IP address and port before running the payload.
